# Vercel Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)
- **Problem**: Dynamic API routes were not properly configured
- **Solution**: Added explicit route mappings for `[driverId]` dynamic routes
- **Changes**: Updated `vercel.json` with proper routing rules for serverless functions

### 2. ✅ PostgreSQL Dependency Removal
- **Problem**: `pg` package was trying to connect to PostgreSQL in serverless environment
- **Solution**: Removed PostgreSQL dependency and simplified to use in-memory storage
- **Changes**: 
  - Updated `api/db.js` to use only in-memory storage
  - Removed `pg` and `ws` dependencies from `package.json`
  - Added `ensureDataIntegrity()` function for serverless initialization

### 3. ✅ Error Handling Improvements
- **Problem**: API routes were returning HTML error pages instead of JSON
- **Solution**: Wrapped all API routes in try-catch with proper JSON error responses
- **Changes**: Updated all API endpoints to:
  - Set `Content-Type: application/json` header
  - Return consistent JSON error responses
  - Include proper CORS headers

### 4. ✅ WebSocket Compatibility
- **Problem**: WebSocket connections don't work on Vercel serverless
- **Solution**: Added serverless environment detection to disable WebSocket
- **Changes**: Modified `public/websocket-manager.js` to:
  - Detect Vercel/serverless environments
  - Skip WebSocket connections on serverless platforms
  - Fall back to HTTP polling

## API Endpoints Now Working

- ✅ `GET /api/data/sync` - System data synchronization
- ✅ `GET /api/driver/locations` - All driver locations
- ✅ `GET /api/driver/[driverId]/routes` - Driver-specific routes
- ✅ `POST /api/driver/[driverId]/location` - Update driver location
- ✅ `POST /api/driver/[driverId]/update` - Update driver data
- ✅ `POST /api/driver/[driverId]/status` - Update driver status
- ✅ `POST /api/driver/[driverId]/fuel` - Update fuel level

## Testing

Use the included `test-api-endpoints.html` file to test all endpoints after deployment:

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Open `https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/test-api-endpoints.html`
3. Click "Test All Endpoints" to verify everything works

## Deployment Command

```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```

## Key Changes Summary

1. **Database**: Switched from PostgreSQL to in-memory storage
2. **WebSocket**: Disabled for serverless, falls back to HTTP polling  
3. **Error Handling**: All endpoints now return proper JSON responses
4. **Routing**: Fixed dynamic route handling in Vercel
5. **Dependencies**: Removed problematic packages (`pg`, `ws`)

## Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for basic functionality. The app will work with in-memory storage by default.

## Expected Behavior

After these fixes:
- ✅ No more 500 Internal Server Errors
- ✅ No more 404 errors on API routes
- ✅ No more WebSocket connection failures
- ✅ No more JSON parsing errors
- ✅ Full sync functionality via HTTP APIs
